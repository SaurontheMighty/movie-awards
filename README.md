# Movie Awards <br />

### [The 1st Annual Shoppie Awards](https://sauronthemighty.github.io/movie-awards/)
### Built for the Summer 2021 Shopify UX and Web Developer Challenge
### By Ashish Selvaraj (selvaraj.ashish@gmail.com) <br /><br />

## What is it: 
A beautiful smooth website to support Shopify's foray into Movie Awards. Allows users to search OMDb for their favourite movies, nominate up to 5 of these movies and if the user wishes, it also saves their nominations as cookies which will be used to restore the session if the user returns.
<br /><br />

## Features: 
- Search OMDb
- Nominate up to 5 movies
- Un-nominate these movies either from the search tile or from the nomination list
- Saves nominations for 30 days in case you want to edit later.
- Notifies users when their five nominations are up.
<br /><br />

## Technologies Used: <br />
- HTML
- CSS - All the styling is done in CSS and no external libraries were used.
- JavaScript - Uses the Fetch API to get data from the OMDb API and also uses JS to control some animations, programatically add HTML elements and create and read cookies.
